## 🔊 English Vowel Sounds / Английские гласные звуки

English has **12 main vowel sounds** (compared to 6 in Russian). This is why pronunciation is challenging!

### **Short Vowels / Короткие гласные**

| Sound | Symbol | Examples | Russian hint | How to say |
|-------|--------|----------|--------------|------------|
| Short A | /æ/ | cat, hat, man, bad | между "э" и "а" | Open mouth wide, tongue down |
| Short E | /e/ | bed, red, pen, let | "э" | Mouth slightly open |
| Short I | /ɪ/ | sit, big, fish, it | короткое "и" | Relaxed, quick sound |
| Short O | /ɒ/ | hot, dog, not, box | "о" | Lips rounded, jaw dropped |
| Short U | /ʌ/ | cup, but, run, fun | "а" | Mouth barely open |
| Schwa | /ə/ | about, banana | нейтральный звук | Most relaxed sound |

### **Long Vowels / Долгие гласные**

| Sound | Symbol | Examples | Russian hint | How to say |
|-------|--------|----------|--------------|------------|
| Long A | /eɪ/ | name, cake, day, make | "эй" | Start with /e/, glide to /ɪ/ |
| Long E | /iː/ | see, me, tea, eat | долгое "и" | Smile, tongue high |
| Long I | /aɪ/ | time, my, like, five | "ай" | Start with /a/, glide to /ɪ/ |
| Long O | /oʊ/ | go, home, no, boat | "оу" | Start with /o/, glide to /ʊ/ |
| Long U | /uː/ | blue, food, you, moon | долгое "у" | Lips very rounded |
| Long U (yoo) | /juː/ | use, music, cute | "ю" | Start with /j/, then /uː/ |

### **Practice: Minimal Pairs**
These words differ by only one sound:

| Short | Long | Listen for the difference |
|-------|------|---------------------------|
| bit /bɪt/ | beat /biːt/ | Short i vs Long ee |
| cat /kæt/ | cart /kɑːt/ | Different vowels |
| cut /kʌt/ | coat /koʊt/ | Short u vs Long o |
| bed /bed/ | bade /beɪd/ | Short e vs Long a |
| full /fʊl/ | fool /fuːl/ | Short oo vs Long oo |

## 🗣 Difficult Consonants / Сложные согласные

### **The TH Sounds (θ and ð)**

English has TWO "th" sounds. Neither exists in Russian!

#### **Voiceless TH /θ/** (глухой)
**How to make it:** 
1. Put your tongue between your teeth
2. Blow air out
3. Do NOT vibrate your vocal cords

**Words:** think, three, thank, bath, tooth, Thursday

**Practice sentences:**
- I **th**ink **th**is is **th**e right answer.
- **Th**ree **th**ousand **th**ings.
- **Th**ank you very much.

#### **Voiced TH /ð/** (звонкий)
**How to make it:**
1. Same tongue position as /θ/
2. But vibrate your vocal cords (like humming)

**Words:** the, this, that, these, those, mother, weather

**Practice sentences:**
- **Th**is is **th**e book **th**at I want.
- **Th**e wea**th**er is nice **th**ese days.
- My mo**th**er and fa**th**er are **th**ere.

#### **Common Mistakes:**
| Wrong | Correct | Why |
|-------|---------|-----|
| "ze book" | "the book" | /ð/ not /z/ |
| "sink" | "think" | /θ/ not /s/ |
| "tree" | "three" | /θ/ not /t/ |
| "wiz" | "with" | /ð/ not /z/ |

---

### **The W Sound /w/**

This sound doesn't exist in Russian. It's NOT the same as V!

**How to make it:**
1. Round your lips into a small circle (like kissing)
2. Keep your teeth APART
3. Make a sound while opening lips

**Words:** water, we, what, where, when, why, want, with, work, world

**Practice: W vs V**
| W sound | V sound |
|---------|---------|
| wine /waɪn/ | vine /vaɪn/ |
| west /west/ | vest /vest/ |
| wet /wet/ | vet /vet/ |
| we /wiː/ | V (letter) /viː/ |

**Practice sentences:**
- **W**hat do you **w**ant?
- **W**here **w**ere you **w**orking?
- The **w**eather **w**as **w**onderful on **W**ednesday.

---

### **The R Sound /r/**

English R is completely different from Russian "р"!

**How to make it:**
1. Curl your tongue back (but don't touch anything!)
2. Keep the tip of your tongue in the air
3. DO NOT trill or roll the R

**Words:** red, run, right, very, more, car, after

**Practice sentences:**
- The **r**ed ca**r** is **r**eally fast.
- **R**emember to **r**ead the **r**eport.
- My b**r**other a**rr**ived in Ap**r**il.

**Common mistakes:**
- Don't tap or roll the R (no "ррр")
- Don't make it too strong at the end of words

---

### **The H Sound /h/**

This is a soft breath, NOT like Russian "х"!

**How to make it:**
1. Open your mouth
2. Breathe out (like fogging a mirror)
3. Add voice immediately after

**Words:** hello, house, happy, have, he, her, his, how, here

**Practice sentences:**
- **H**ello! **H**ow are you?
- **H**e has a **h**ouse on the **h**ill.
- I **h**ope you're **h**appy **h**ere.

**Warning:** Don't add H where it doesn't belong!
- "apple" NOT "happle"
- "I am" NOT "I ham"

---

## 📊 Word Stress / Ударение в словах

English words have STRESS (ударение). One syllable is louder and longer.

### **Basic Rules:**

**Rule 1: Most 2-syllable NOUNS - stress on FIRST syllable**
- **TA**ble, **AP**ple, **MU**sic, **WA**ter, **DOC**tor

**Rule 2: Most 2-syllable VERBS - stress on SECOND syllable**
- be**GIN**, a**RRIVE**, de**CIDE**, en**JOY**, ex**PLAIN**

**Rule 3: Words ending in -tion, -sion - stress before these endings**
- in-for-**MA**-tion, de-ci-**SION**, edu-**CA**-tion

**Rule 4: Words ending in -ic - stress on the syllable before -ic**
- fan-**TAS**-tic, dra-**MAT**-ic, e-lec-**TRON**-ic

### **Practice Words:**

| Word | Stress Pattern | Syllables |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| **TEA**cher | ● ○ | TEA-cher |
| com-**PU**-ter | ○ ● ○ | com-PU-ter |
| in-**TER**-es-ting | ○ ● ○ ○ | in-TER-es-ting |
| un-der-**STAND** | ○ ○ ● | un-der-STAND |
| **BEAU**-ti-ful | ● ○ ○ | BEAU-ti-ful |

## 🔄 Connected Speech / Связная речь

In natural English, words connect together!

### **Linking Rules:**

**1. Consonant + Vowel linking:**
"an apple" → "a**n‿a**pple"
"is it" → "i**s‿i**t"

**2. Same consonant = one sound:**
"bad day" → "ba**d d**ay" (one long D)
"black cat" → "bla**ck c**at" (one long K)

**3. T/D between vowels = soft sound:**
"water" → "wa**d**er" (American English)
"better" → "be**d**er"

### **Common Phrases (how they really sound):**

| Written | Spoken | IPA |
|---------|--------|-----|
| want to | "wanna" | /ˈwɒnə/ |
| going to | "gonna" | /ˈɡɒnə/ |
| have to | "hafta" | /ˈhæftə/ |
| kind of | "kinda" | /ˈkaɪndə/ |
| don't know | "dunno" | /dəˈnoʊ/ |
