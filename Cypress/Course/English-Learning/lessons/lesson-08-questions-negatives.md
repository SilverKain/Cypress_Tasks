## ❓ Part 1: Yes/No Questions

### Formation Pattern

**Auxiliary Verb + Subject + Main Verb + ?**

### Present Simple Questions

| Statement | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| You like coffee. | **Do** you like coffee? |
| She speaks English. | **Does** she speak English? |
| They work here. | **Do** they work here? |
| He plays tennis. | **Does** he play tennis? |

**Note:** With he/she/it, use DOES and the verb loses the -s:
- She speak**s** → Does she speak?
- He work**s** → Does he work?

### Present Continuous Questions

| Statement | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| You are working. | **Are** you working? |
| She is sleeping. | **Is** she sleeping? |
| They are coming. | **Are** they coming? |

### Past Simple Questions

| Statement | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| You went home. | **Did** you go home? |
| She finished. | **Did** she finish? |
| They saw the movie. | **Did** they see the movie? |

**Note:** With DID, use the base form of the verb:
- She went → Did she **go**?
- He finished → Did he **finish**?

### Questions with BE

With "be" as the main verb, no auxiliary needed:

| Statement | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| You are happy. | **Are** you happy? |
| She was tired. | **Was** she tired? |
| They were at home. | **Were** they at home? |

### Questions with Modal Verbs

Modal verbs become the auxiliary:

| Statement | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| You can swim. | **Can** you swim? |
| She should go. | **Should** she go? |
| They will come. | **Will** they come? |
| He must leave. | **Must** he leave? |
