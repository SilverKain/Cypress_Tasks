## 📖 Part 1: What's the Difference?

### Adjectives describe NOUNS (things, people)
### Adverbs describe VERBS, ADJECTIVES, or other ADVERBS

| Adjective | Adverb |
|-----------|--------|
| She is a **beautiful** singer. | She sings **beautifully**. |
| He is a **slow** driver. | He drives **slowly**. |
| It was a **quick** decision. | He decided **quickly**. |
| They are **careful** workers. | They work **carefully**. |

### Key Questions:
- **Adjective:** WHAT kind? (What kind of singer? → beautiful)
- **Adverb:** HOW? (How does she sing? → beautifully)

---

## 🔤 Part 2: Forming Adverbs

### Rule 1: Add -LY to most adjectives

| Adjective | Adverb |
|-----------|--------|
| slow | slow**ly** |
| quick | quick**ly** |
| careful | careful**ly** |
| beautiful | beautiful**ly** |
| serious | serious**ly** |
| perfect | perfect**ly** |
| quiet | quiet**ly** |
| polite | polite**ly** |

### Rule 2: Adjectives ending in -Y → change Y to -ILY

| Adjective | Adverb |
|-----------|--------|
| happy | happ**ily** |
| easy | eas**ily** |
| angry | angr**ily** |
| lucky | luck**ily** |
| heavy | heav**ily** |
| lazy | laz**ily** |

### Rule 3: Adjectives ending in -LE → change -LE to -LY

| Adjective | Adverb |
|-----------|--------|
| simple | simp**ly** |
| terrible | terrib**ly** |
| comfortable | comfortab**ly** |
| possible | possib**ly** |
| probable | probab**ly** |

### Rule 4: Adjectives ending in -IC → add -ALLY

| Adjective | Adverb |
|-----------|--------|
| basic | basic**ally** |
| automatic | automatic**ally** |
| dramatic | dramatic**ally** |
| tragic | tragic**ally** |
| **Exception:** public | public**ly** |

### Rule 5: Irregular Adverbs (same form or different)

| Adjective | Adverb |
|-----------|--------|
| good | **well** |
| fast | **fast** |
| hard | **hard** |
| late | **late** |
| early | **early** |
| daily | **daily** |
| high | **high** |
| low | **low** |

**⚠️ Careful:**
- hard (adverb) = with effort: *He works hard.*
- hardly (adverb) = almost not: *I hardly know him.*
- late (adverb) = not on time: *He arrived late.*
- lately (adverb) = recently: *Have you seen him lately?*

## 📍 Part 3: Position of Adjectives

- She looks **happy**.
- The food smells **delicious**.

### Order of Multiple Adjectives:

**Opinion → Size → Age → Shape → Color → Origin → Material → Purpose**

|---------|------|-----|-------|-------|--------|----------|---------|------|
| lovely | big | old | round | blue | French | wooden | dining | table |
