## 📚 What is a Noun? / Что такое существительное?

A **noun** is a word that names:
- **People:** teacher, doctor, Anna, friend
- **Places:** city, Russia, school, home
- **Things:** book, table, phone, car
- **Ideas:** love, happiness, education, time

### **Types of Nouns:**

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Common nouns** | General names | city, dog, book |
| **Proper nouns** | Specific names (capitalized) | Moscow, John, Monday |
| **Countable nouns** | Can be counted | apple(s), car(s), idea(s) |
| **Uncountable nouns** | Cannot be counted | water, music, information |

## 🔤 Articles: A, An, The

English has THREE articles. Russian doesn't have articles, so this is a new concept!

### **Indefinite Articles: A / AN**

Use **a** or **an** for:
- **First mention** of something
- **One of many** things
- **General statements**

| Article | When to use | Examples |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **A** | Before consonant sounds | a book, a car, a university |
| **AN** | Before vowel sounds | an apple, an hour, an umbrella |

⚠️ **Important:** It's about the SOUND, not the letter!
- "a university" (because "university" starts with /j/ sound)
- "an hour" (because the "h" is silent)
- "a European" (because it starts with /j/ sound)
- "an honest person" (because "h" is silent)

### **Practice: A or AN?**
1. ___ apple *(an - starts with vowel sound)*
2. ___ banana *(a - starts with consonant)*
3. ___ university *(a - starts with /j/ sound)*
4. ___ hour *(an - silent h)*
5. ___ European country *(a - starts with /j/ sound)*
6. ___ honest answer *(an - silent h)*
7. ___ one-way street *(a - starts with /w/ sound)*
8. ___ umbrella *(an - starts with vowel)*

| Situation | Example | Explanation |

| **Second mention** | I have a car. **The** car is red. | Already mentioned |
| **Only one exists** | **the** sun, **the** moon, **the** internet | Unique things |
| **Superlatives** | **the** best, **the** biggest | Only one can be best |
| **With "of"** | **the** capital of Russia | Specific reference |
