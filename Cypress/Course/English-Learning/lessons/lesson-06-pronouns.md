## 👤 Personal Pronouns / Личные местоимения

### **Subject Pronouns (Именительный падеж)**
Used as the SUBJECT of a sentence:

| English | Russian | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **I** | я | **I** am a student. |
| **you** | ты / вы | **You** are kind. |
| **he** | он | **He** is my brother. |
| **she** | она | **She** works here. |
| **it** | оно / это | **It** is cold today. |
| **we** | мы | **We** are friends. |
| **they** | они | **They** live in Moscow. |

### **Object Pronouns (Объектный падеж)**
Used as the OBJECT of a verb or after prepositions:

| Subject | Object | Russian | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|---------|
| I | **me** | меня/мне | Help **me**, please. |
| you | **you** | тебя/тебе | I see **you**. |
| he | **him** | его/ему | Call **him**. |
| she | **her** | её/ей | I love **her**. |
| it | **it** | его/ему/её/ей | Give **it** to me. |
| we | **us** | нас/нам | Join **us**. |
| they | **them** | их/им | I know **them**. |

### **When to Use Object Pronouns:**

## 📌 Subject vs Object Pronouns

| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Correct | Rule |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Me am hungry. | **I** am hungry. | Subject = I |
| Give it to I. | Give it to **me**. | After preposition = me |
| Her is beautiful. | **She** is beautiful. | Subject = She |
| I saw she. | I saw **her**. | Object of verb = her |
| Him and me went. | **He** and **I** went. | Subjects = He, I |
| Call he. | Call **him**. | Object = him |

### **Practice: I or ME?**
1. ___ am from Russia. (I)
2. Call ___ later. (me)
3. ___ and my sister are students. (I)
4. Between you and ___, it's a secret. (me)
5. ___ love this city. (I)

## 💼 Possessive Adjectives / Притяжательные прилагательные

Possessive adjectives show OWNERSHIP. They come BEFORE nouns.

| Subject | Possessive Adj. | Russian | Example |
|---------|-----------------|---------|---------|
| I | **my** | мой/моя/моё/мои | **my** book |
| you | **your** | твой/ваш | **your** car |
| he | **his** | его | **his** phone |
| she | **her** | её | **her** bag |
| it | **its** | его/её | The dog wagged **its** tail. |
| we | **our** | наш | **our** house |
| they | **their** | их | **their** children |

### **Key Points:**
1. Possessive adjectives **don't change** for gender or number:
   - my book / my books (NOT: mys books)
   - his mother / his father (same form)

2. **its** vs **it's**:
   - **its** = possessive (The cat ate its food.)
   - **it's** = it is (It's cold today.)

## 💎 Possessive Pronouns / Притяжательные местоимения

Possessive pronouns REPLACE "possessive adjective + noun." They stand ALONE.

| Possessive Adj. | Possessive Pronoun | Example |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------|
| my | **mine** | This book is **mine**. |
| your | **yours** | Is this **yours**? |
| his | **his** | The car is **his**. |
| her | **hers** | The bag is **hers**. |
| its | — | (rarely used) |
| our | **ours** | The house is **ours**. |
| their | **theirs** | These seats are **theirs**. |

### **Comparison:**
| Possessive Adjective | Possessive Pronoun |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| This is **my** book. | This book is **mine**. |
| That's **your** car. | That car is **yours**. |
| It's **her** bag. | The bag is **hers**. |
| This is **our** house. | This house is **ours**. |

## 🔄 Reflexive Pronouns / Возвратные местоимения

Used when the subject and object are the SAME person:

| Subject | Reflexive | Russian | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------|
| I | **myself** | себя/сам | I hurt **myself**. |
| you (sg.) | **yourself** | себя/сам | Help **yourself**! |
| he | **himself** | себя/сам | He taught **himself**. |
| she | **herself** | себя/сама | She made it **herself**. |
| it | **itself** | себя/само | The cat cleaned **itself**. |
| we | **ourselves** | себя/сами | We enjoyed **ourselves**. |
| you (pl.) | **yourselves** | себя/сами | Make **yourselves** at home. |
| they | **themselves** | себя/сами | They introduced **themselves**. |

### **Uses of Reflexive Pronouns:**
