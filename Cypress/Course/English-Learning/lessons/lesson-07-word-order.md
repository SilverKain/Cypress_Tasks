## 📖 Basic Word Order: SVO

### Subject → Verb → Object

English has a strict word order. The basic pattern is:

**Subject + Verb + Object (SVO)**

| Subject | Verb | Object |
|---------|------|--------|
| I | eat | breakfast |
| She | reads | books |
| They | play | football |
| The cat | caught | a mouse |
| My mother | loves | cooking |

### Compare with Russian:

In Russian, word order is flexible because of cases:
- Мама любит папу = Папу любит мама (same meaning)

In English, word order determines meaning:
- Mom loves Dad ≠ Dad loves Mom (different meanings!)

### 📝 Important:
**The subject ALWAYS comes before the verb in statements!**

❌ *Goes she to school* → ✅ **She goes to school**
❌ *Speaks English he* → ✅ **He speaks English**

---

## 📍 Place of Adjectives

### Adjectives come BEFORE nouns

| English (Adj + Noun) | Russian (may vary) |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| a beautiful girl | красивая девушка |
| a big house | большой дом |
| cold water | холодная вода |
| an interesting book | интересная книга |

### Multiple Adjectives - Order Matters!

When using multiple adjectives, follow this order:

**Opinion → Size → Age → Shape → Color → Origin → Material → Purpose + NOUN**

| Opinion | Size | Age | Shape | Color | Origin | Material | Purpose | Noun |
|---------|------|-----|-------|-------|--------|----------|---------|------|
| beautiful | big | old | round | blue | Italian | wooden | dining | table |
| lovely | small | new | square | red | Japanese | cotton | sleeping | bag |

**Examples:**
- a **beautiful old** house (opinion + age)
- a **big blue** car (size + color)
- a **small Italian** restaurant (size + origin)
- a **lovely old wooden** chair (opinion + age + material)

### Adjectives with "be" - come AFTER

| Subject | Verb | Adjective |
|---------|------|-----------|
| The sky | is | blue |
| She | is | beautiful |
| They | are | happy |
| The food | was | delicious |

---

## 📍 Place of Adverbs

### Adverbs of Frequency (always, usually, often, sometimes, never)

**Position: BEFORE the main verb, AFTER "be"**

| Subject | Adverb | Verb | Object |
|---------|--------|------|--------|
| I | always | eat | breakfast |
| She | usually | drinks | tea |
| They | sometimes | visit | us |
| We | never | eat | fast food |

**But with "be":**

| Subject | Be | Adverb | |
|---------|-----|--------|---|
| I | am | always | late |
| She | is | usually | happy |
| They | are | never | home |

### Adverbs of Manner (how?)

**Position: AFTER the verb or AFTER the object**

| Subject | Verb | Object | Adverb |
|---------|------|--------|--------|
| She | sings | - | beautifully |
| He | speaks | English | fluently |
| They | did | the work | carefully |
| I | closed | the door | quietly |

### Adverbs of Place and Time

**Basic rule: PLACE before TIME**

| Subject | Verb | Object | Place | Time |
|---------|------|--------|-------|------|
| I | met | her | at the café | yesterday |
| We | go | - | to school | every day |
| She | works | - | at home | on Mondays |

---

## 📍 Position of Time Expressions

### Beginning or End of Sentence

Time expressions can go at the beginning OR end:

**At the end (most common):**
- I went to the cinema **yesterday**.
- She will call you **tomorrow**.
- We have a meeting **next week**.

**At the beginning (for emphasis):**
- **Yesterday**, I went to the cinema.
- **Tomorrow**, she will call you.
- **Next week**, we have a meeting.

### Common Time Expressions:

| Time | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Specific time** | at 5 o'clock, at noon, at midnight |
| **Days** | on Monday, on Tuesday, on weekends |
| **Dates** | on January 5th, on my birthday |
| **Parts of day** | in the morning, in the afternoon, at night |
| **Months/Years** | in January, in 2024, in summer |
| **Duration** | for 2 hours, since 2020 |
