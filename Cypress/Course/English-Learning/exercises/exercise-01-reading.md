## 📖 Text 3: Learning a New Language (Level B1)

### Text:

Learning a new language is one of the most rewarding experiences you can have. However, it requires patience, dedication, and consistent practice. Here are some effective strategies that can help you on your language learning journey.

First, set clear and realistic goals. Instead of saying "I want to speak English fluently," try setting specific targets like "I will learn 20 new words this week" or "I will have a 5-minute conversation in English by next month." Small, achievable goals keep you motivated and help you track your progress.

Second, immerse yourself in the language as much as possible. Change your phone's language settings to English. Watch movies and TV shows in English with subtitles. Listen to English podcasts or music during your commute. The more you surround yourself with the language, the faster you will learn.

Third, don't be afraid of making mistakes. Many learners are too embarrassed to speak because they fear they will say something wrong. However, mistakes are a natural part of the learning process. Native speakers usually appreciate your efforts and are happy to help you improve.

Fourth, practice regularly. It's better to study for 30 minutes every day than for 3 hours once a week. Consistency is key when building new habits. Even on busy days, try to do at least one small language activity.

Finally, find ways to make learning enjoyable. If you love cooking, watch cooking shows in English. If you're interested in technology, read tech blogs in English. When you connect learning with your interests, it becomes much easier and more fun.

Remember, everyone learns at their own pace. Don't compare yourself to others. Celebrate your small victories and keep going. With time and effort, you will achieve your language goals.

## 📖 Text 4: The History of Coffee (Level B1-B2)

### Text:

Coffee is one of the world's most popular beverages, consumed by millions of people every day. But have you ever wondered where this beloved drink comes from?

The history of coffee dates back to the 15th century in Ethiopia. According to legend, a goat herder named Kaldi noticed that his goats became unusually energetic after eating berries from a certain tree. Curious, he tried the berries himself and experienced a similar boost of energy. He shared his discovery with local monks, who found that a drink made from these berries helped them stay awake during long hours of prayer.

From Ethiopia, coffee spread to Yemen and then to the rest of the Arab world. By the 16th century, coffee houses had become popular gathering places in cities like Constantinople (now Istanbul), Cairo, and Mecca. These establishments were often called "schools of the wise" because people would meet there to discuss literature, politics, and philosophy.

Coffee arrived in Europe in the 17th century, initially meeting some resistance. Some people called it the "bitter invention of Satan." However, Pope Clement VIII reportedly tasted it, found it delicious, and gave it papal approval. After that, coffee houses quickly spread across Europe, becoming centers of intellectual and social activity.

The coffee trade expanded globally in the 18th and 19th centuries. European colonial powers established coffee plantations in their colonies, particularly in Indonesia, Central America, and South America. Brazil eventually became the world's largest coffee producer, a position it still holds today.

Today, coffee is a multi-billion dollar industry. The global coffee market is worth over $100 billion annually. Beyond its economic importance, coffee plays a significant cultural role in many societies. From Italian espresso bars to American coffee chains, from Ethiopian coffee ceremonies to Swedish fika (coffee break), this simple beverage has become an integral part of human culture worldwide.
